 # Recognition and Detection of Vehicles, their Brand, Colour and Speed

This project uses data science techniques to detect the speed of cars in a video stream. It utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect cars in a video and estimate their speed based on their size and the frame rate of the video. Additionally, it uses Flask, a web framework, to create an interface for users to interact with the backend and see the results of the analysis. The frontend and backend are connected through Flask, allowing for easy communication and seamless integration between the two components.
